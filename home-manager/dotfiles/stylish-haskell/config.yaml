# stylish-haskell configuration file
# ==================================
#
steps:

  # Language pragmas
  - language_pragmas:
      # We can generate different styles of language pragma lists.
      #
      # - vertical: Vertical-spaced language pragmas, one per line.
      #
      # - compact: A more compact style.
      #
      # - compact_line: Similar to compact, but wrap each line with
      #   `{-#LANGUAGE #-}'.
      #
      # Default: vertical.
      style: vertical

      # Align affects alignment of closing pragma brackets.
      #
      # - true: Brackets are aligned in same column.
      #
      # - false: Brackets are not aligned together. There is only one space
      #   between actual import and closing bracket.
      #
      # Default: true
      align: true

      # stylish-haskell can detect redundancy of some language pragmas. If this
      # is set to true, it will remove those redundant pragmas. Default: true.
      remove_redundant: true

  # Replace tabs by spaces. This is disabled by default.
  - tabs:
      # Number of spaces to use for each tab. Default: 8, as specified by the
      # Haskell report.
      spaces: 8

  # Remove trailing whitespace
  - trailing_whitespace: {}

  # Squash multiple spaces between the left and right hand sides of some
  # elements into single spaces. Basically, this undoes the effect of
  # simple_align but is a bit less conservative.
  # - squash: {}

# A common setting is the number of columns (parts of) code will be wrapped
# to. Different steps take this into account. Default: 80.
columns: 110

# By default, line endings are converted according to the OS. You can override
# preferred format here.
#
# - native: Native newline format. CRLF on Windows, LF on other OSes.
#
# - lf: Convert to LF ("\n").
#
# - crlf: Convert to CRLF ("\r\n").
#
# Default: native.
newline: native

# Sometimes, language extensions are specified in a cabal file or from the
# command line instead of using language pragmas in the file. stylish-haskell
# needs to be aware of these, so it can parse the file correctly.
#
# No language extensions are enabled by default.
# language_extensions:
  # - TemplateHaskell
  # - QuasiQuotes
